            <p class="description">This is a project I built using the API from thesportsdb.com. You can input the name
                of a sports player and it will return any information about that player that is availalbe in the
                database.</p>

            <h2>Memory Game</h2>
            <p class="description">A classic memory matching game. I added a few features to them game such as the
                highscore tracker that uses local storage to save even if the browser is closed out. Also, a short
                message will appear at the end of the game depening on whether or not a new highscore was achieved</p>

            <p class="description">As the most commonly suggested first project for an aspiring Javascript developer the
                Todo List does not require much of an introduction. The star to mark an item as important and the
                character limit counter are cool extra features. Oh, and then there is the "Easter egg".</p>

                the skills at that time. It uses the API from scryfall.com to pull a random card from Magic the
                Gathering. It also has a few filters that are able to be applied.</p>

        <p>My name is Keith LePoidevin and I enjoy watching football and shooting hoops. I also enjoy playing Magic the
            Gathering, hence the card generator project I created. I am an aspiring self taught web developer. I say
            aspiring as I am still looking for someone to take a chance on me and provide me with my first job as
            developer. I continue to code and learn and am only going to get better from here as I become a strong web
            developer.</p>
